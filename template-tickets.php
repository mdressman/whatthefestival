								<p style="font-size: 13px; margin-top: -15px;">What The Festival does not guarantee any tickets purchased on Craigslist or any other 3rd party. We encourage all sales to go directly through EventBrite as there are plenty of GA and OMG tickets still available. If you bought or are selling a ticket via a 3rd party site, we will not guarantee them or issue any refunds should there be a problem with the Print At Home Ticket. Please make all purchases directly from us via the EventBrite site (Please keep in mind that even if a ticket has an EventBrite logo on it, that it could be fraudulent unless it is purchased directly from their site). Also be aware that fraud can exist when selling to an unsuspecting 3rd party.</p>
